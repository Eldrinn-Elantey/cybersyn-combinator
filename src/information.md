# Cybersyn Combinator

This mod adds a new fancy combinator to the game, made to be used with the [Project Cybersyn][cybersyn] mod.

It functions like a regular constant combinator, but has built-in support for setting the various Cybersyn-specific signals.

## Features

 - More slots than a regular constant combinator (configurable)
 - Dedicated inputs for Cybersyn signals
   - Request threshold
   - Priority
   - Locked slots
 - Ability to input signals using stack counts
 - You could use it instead of a constant combinator for purposes other than Cybersyn, if you want to (perhaps for the higher slot count)

## Roadmap

 - Add a built-in way to configure sub-network masks.

## Bugs/support/feature requests/questions

You can use the discussion area on the Factorio mods site, but you are more likely to receive a timely response by communicating via the [repository on GitHub][github].

## Acknowledgements

This mod was made with inspiration from the similar mod [LTN Combinator Modernized][ltnc] for the [Logistic Train Network][ltn] mod.
