# Cybersyn Combinator

A mod for Factorio that adds a special combinator for use with the [Project Cybersyn][cybersyn] mod.

## Usage

*TODO*

## Acknowledgements

A lot was gained from looking at how the [LTN Combinator Modernized][ltnc] mod does things, so big thanks are due to that mod for getting up and running with the Cybersyn version.
